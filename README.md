# What is `tmplr` ?

It's a CLI tool that's primarily meant to help with starting a new project, but it is a general file system templating solution.

Instead of relying on config files, complicated scripts or generators, the idea is to use files and folders themselves as a template.

# Motivation

Let say you are working on your own JS framework _(because there is not enough of them)_ and you want your users to be able to dive right into it instead of spending time configuring and installing all billion packages and stuff.

What do you do? You create a CLI tool that does all the boilerplatey stuff.

So the question is can this problem be generalized and fixed with one solution not only for the Javascript ecosystem but other languages as well?

# Analysis

> [!CAUTION]
> WORK IN PROGRESS

Here are different project structure requirements based on programming languages:

JS (Node, Bun, etc.):

Go:

C#:

Rust:

# Proposal

Let's introduce a syntax for file and folder names as well as general templating syntax that's compatible with various file types.
